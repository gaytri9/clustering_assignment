# Clustering Assignment 

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a clustering assignment using PyCaret. The assignment involves implementing three clustering algorithms (K-means, MeanShift, and Hierarchical Clustering) and plotting 3D graphs for visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this assignment is [provide dataset name and source]. This dataset contains [brief description of the dataset].

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
3. Install the required libraries by running:pycaret

## Code Structure
- `clustering_assignment.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the clustering assignment.
- `data/`: Credit-Card-Dataset.
- `plots/`: images of 3d plots.

## Implementation
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset.
- Perform any necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.

### 2. Clustering Algorithms
- Implement K-means clustering using PyCaret.
- Implement MeanShift clustering using PyCaret.
- Implement Hierarchical Clustering using PyCaret.

### 3. Visualization
- Plot 3D graphs to visualize the clusters generated by each algorithm.
- Save the plots in the `plots/` directory.

## Running the Code
1. Open `clustering_assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute each cell in the notebook to run the code.
3. The notebook will generate plots and display the results of each clustering algorithm.

## Results
- K-means clustering: [Silhouette=0.5568]
- MeanShift clustering: [Silhouette=0.6358]
- Hierarchical Clustering: [Silhouette=0.5225]

## Conclusion
In this assignment, we implemented three clustering algorithms (K-means, MeanShift, Hierarchical Clustering) using PyCaret and visualized the clusters using 3D graphs. Each algorithm generated distinct clusters, and further analysis can be done to interpret and evaluate the results.
